# Turbo Data Lake 


I AM ANTISOCIAL README TERRORIST
AI SUMMARISE AND WRITE IT WTF....
and fix the whole thing :) 

This is the first stab of building a data lake with DuckDB, Parquet, DBT, Dagster and do it with OLAP single machine super fast ways to get around the very complicated MDS, and really simplify the whole stack. 

DuckDB feelsl like a fresh air, and with the Dagster integration which leverages the Software Defined Assets (SDA) instead of the well known Airflow tasks (DAG), it feels like an amazing and really superpowered dev experience so far. 

This is a very experimental build, but, I plan to expand this will Meltano and Airbyte CLI Octavia, and load the DBT models and Airbyte resources as Dagster Assets to see whole ephemeral and omplete end-to-end single data lake and its orchestration around it.
